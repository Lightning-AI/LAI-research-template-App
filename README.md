# lightning-template-research-app

Research Poster App helps Authors and Readers to publish and view research, code, experiment reports,
articles or any resource within the same app.

## Get started

You can fork or clone this template app and start editing or overriding the content.

### Installation

Step 1: Install `lightning`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/lightning.git
cd lightning
# mandatory step to pull the dependencies from extra-index-url
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
python scripts/download_frontend.py
```

Step 2: Clone Research App

```
git clone https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/lightning-template-research-app.git
cd lightning-template-research-app
python setup.py install develop
```

### Share your Research with Lightning App

The poster app has a `ResearchAppFlow` class that provides flags that you can use to build an app without knowing
quickly any web development.

You can provide the links for each flag, and the app will automatically load and show each of the content in tabs.

You can fork and clone the repo to edit the arguments and update the markdown poster or Gradio app.

```python
from lightning import LightningApp
from app import ResearchAppFlow

paper = "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.00020.pdf"
blog = "https://openai.com/blog/clip/"
github = "https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip"
wandb = "https://wandb.ai/aniketmaurya/herbarium-2022/runs/2dvwrme5"

app = LightningApp(
    ResearchAppFlow(
        paper=paper,
        blog=blog,
        experiment_manager=wandb,
        enable_jupyter=True,
        enable_gradio=True,
    )
)
```

To run this app, launch the terminal and enter `lightning run app FILENAME.py`

You should see something like this in your browser:

You can also run the app on cloud by just providing `cloud` flag in the command.
`lightning run app app.py --name my_research_app --cloud`

## Making contributions

**Step 1:** Install the `pre-commit` hook `pre-commit install`.

**Step 2:** Create a new branch with your code changes.

(Optional) Run pre-commit locally to check for any errors before committing: `pre-commit run --all-files`.

**Step 3:** Submit a pull request to the `lightning-template-research-app` main branch repository.
